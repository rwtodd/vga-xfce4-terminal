# VGA Colors for xfce4-terminal

Since I switched to xfce4, I wanted the terminal to use traditional
EGA/VGA colors. Looking at their `colorscheme` files, I found it
wasn't hard to create one myself.

For reference, the colors are:

![vga color set](assets/vga.png)

## Installation

Put `vga.theme` in `~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes`,
and then "VGA Colors" will appear in the terminal preference options.

## License

I put an MIT license on this one.  Obey it or else!
